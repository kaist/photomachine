<h2>Filter by rating</h2>
The plugin allows you to filter photos by their rating (asterisks) if it is recorded in EXIF photos.<br>
The main application is putting ratings on the desired photos directly on the camera (tested on Canon). For example, you can put photos for uploading to the Internet with one star, and photos for printing with two stars.

<p>
<strong style="color:green">Useful:</strong> To speed up the work, you can disable uploading photos in the "from folder" plugin, then filtering will happen very quickly and only those photos that have passed the filter will be uploaded. To do this, after this plugin, place the "image upload"
plugin </p>
<strong>Example: </strong> Uploading photos from a folder (for example, from an SD card). If the rating is set to 1 star, then we upload and send photos to print, if there is more than one star, we send photos to the google drive cloud. And also, all those who have passed the selection, we save to disk in one folder.
