<h2>Viewer plugin</h2>
<p>
The plugin opens a window with a preview of photos and shows all the photos that have passed through it on the full screen. You can also enable viewing "before and after", but at the same time, the source of photos should receive them from the local disk and there should not be a file renaming plugin in front of this plugin.
