<h2>WEB Server plugin</h2>
<p>
The plugin launches a built-in web server for a beautiful display of photos. This is especially useful at various events where photos can be shown in the background on a projector or televisions.<br>
	Configure and run the plugin, open the browser and go to one of the addresses specified in the settings. Now all incoming photos will be shown in the form of a beautiful animation.
</p>
<p>
The plugin has two built-in themes for displaying photos. You can also customize them, or make your own. For this:
	<ol>
		<li>Go to the folder with the program (program files or to another place where you installed it)</li>
		<li>Go to the plugin folder and copy the desired theme to another location: plugins/web_server/themes</li>
<li>You can change the theme, or create your own by analogy.</li>
		<li>Specify the folder with your theme in the settings.</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<p>
	In the settings, you can specify whether to clear the database of photos at the start of the program, or to clear it manually. And also, specify the text that will be displayed on top, background images, logo, or generate a QR code from the link.
