<h2>Photoshop Actions Plugin</h2>
<p>
The plugin is able to apply the actions of the installed Photoshop to the photo. In the settings, select the desired action, and Photoshop will apply it to photos.

<strong style="color:red;">ATTENTION!!! </strong> The action should end with the actions "save" and "close". Without this, the plugin will not be able to pick up the image modified by Photoshop.
