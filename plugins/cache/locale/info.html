<h2>"cache"plugin</h2>
The plugin caches photos in the file system.<br>
This can be useful if the queue for processing photos is moving slowly, and the source of the photos (for example, a USB flash drive) needs to be released as soon as possible. <br>
The cache is saved between program reboots, but you can enable automatic clearing of it when the plugin starts.
