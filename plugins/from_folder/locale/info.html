<h2>Plugin "from folder"</h2>
The plugin downloads photos from a folder. You can do this once, or scan the folder with some frequency, if this is set in the settings. This option is useful if a USB flash drive with photos is inserted into the computer and you need to automatically take new photos from there.
<strong>Settings:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Search in subdirectories - if installed, the plugin will scan photos not only from this folder, but also in all its subdirectories.</li>

<li>Do not upload photos, only metadata - enable if there is a filter after this plugin (for example, by rating). This will speed up the uploading of photos. Don't forget to add the "download source" plugin later</li>
<li>Do not open photos that have already been processed. If installed, the plugin remembers already opened photos from the free database and does not process them again.</li>
<li>Clear the database at startup. If installed, the database of processed photos will be cleared at startup. You can also clean it manually here.</li>
<li>Read the folder once, or scan it periodically, which is set in the settings.</li>
<li>Delete the original ones. It is necessary in rare cases, I would not advise putting a check mark here.</li>
</ul>
