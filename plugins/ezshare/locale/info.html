<h2> "ezShare"plugin</h2>
The plugin allows you to receive photos via WiFi from an ezShare memory card (with a built-in WiFi module)<br>
Photos are searched and downloaded in all folders and only jpg files. Photos that have already been downloaded are not downloaded again - a built-in database is responsible for this. In the settings, you can enable automatic cleaning of this database at startup, or do it manually. <br>
The plugin connects to the memory card via WiFi with a frequency that is set in the settings. You can continue taking photos, the plugin will download new photos automatically.

You can enable automatic connection to the ezShare WiFi network. To do this, connect to it once using standard windows tools. After that, select this network in the settings.<br>
Also, you can enable automatic switching to another WiFi network after the plugin finishes its work. This can be useful if these photos need to be uploaded somewhere on the Internet in the future. Don't forget to pause between connections more!

<strong style="color: green">Useful:</strong> When connected to the ezShare WiFi network, the browser with the ezShare page automatically starts. If this also pisses you off like me, click on the magic button that disables this behavior in Windows. Don't forget to turn it back on later.
