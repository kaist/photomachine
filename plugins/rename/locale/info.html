<h2>Rename plugin</h2>
<p>
The plugin renames the photo. There are several renaming options available: using a counter and using the date/time (shooting or current)<br>
The renaming pattern is set in the corresponding field in the settings. Example:<br>
<code>IMAGE_[COUNT]</code> with the number of digits 4, will output the file name <code>IMAGE_0001.jpg </code>
And the pattern: <code>[YEAR]_[MONTH]_[DAY]_[COUNT]</code> will give <code>2022_05_18_0001.jpg </code>

<p>
You can also create subdirectories automatically. For example:
<code>[YEAR]/[MONTH]/[DAY]/[COUNT]</code> when saving the file, it will create a directory 2022/05/31 and the file will be saved with the name 0000.jpg
</p>
</p>
<p>
You can set the counter to 0 every time the plugin starts, or do it manually in the settings.
