<h2>Plugin "Save Original"</h2>
<p>
The plugin saves the original (source) file to the selected folder. It can be useful, for example, if the photo machine is used only for filtering or sorting photos.

<strong style="color:red;">ATTENTION!!!</strong> the plugin can save the original only photos that are received from disk, but not photos that are received from the network (for example, from telegram or WiFi)
