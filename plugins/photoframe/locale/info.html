<h2>Photo frame plugin</h2>
<p>
The plugin inserts an image into a photo frame template, which is set in the settings. The template can be any png image with transparency in the right places. It is possible to set a template separately for vertical and horizontal photos. 
</p>
<p>
	Also, in the settings, you can specify to fit the image into a photo frame (the image will become the size of a photo frame and perhaps a part will be cut off if the template has other proportions), or to fit the photo frame into the size of the image (the photo frame can be cropped if it is of a different proportion)
