<h2>Time filter</h2>
The plugin allows you to filter photos by shooting time. For example, if you want to skip only photos taken in the last 24 hours or in the last 10 minutes.
<p>
In the settings, you can choose the unit of measurement of time, its value and the condition "more" or "less". The time is taken from the EXIF and compared with the current time (the moment when the photo arrives to the plugin)

<strong style="color:red;">ATTENTION!!</strong> If there is no shooting time in EXIF, then such a photo will not be missed by the plugin.
