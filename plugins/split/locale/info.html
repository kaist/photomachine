<p>The plugin sends photos in turn to each of the plug-ins connected to it. For example, if 2 plug-ins are connected to the output, then the first image will be sent to the first plug-in connected, the second image to the second, and so on. Why would this be useful? For example, for faster photo processing, using a multi-core processor.</p>
