<h2>Plugin "Copies"</h2>
<p>
The plugin copies the image several times. The number of images is set in the settings. 
</p>
<p>
<strong style="color:green;">EXAMPLE</strong> The plugin can be used, for example, when printing photos, when you need to print more than one photo.<br>
	Such use is well combined, for example, with a rating filter. For example, you can print one photo if the rating is one star, two photos if the rating is two stars, and so on.
