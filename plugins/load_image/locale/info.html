<h2>Plugin "upload source image"</h2>
<p>
If the "do not upload the original" option is set in the plugin that loads the image, then the program will read only the metadata of the photo, and not the image itself. This is necessary, for example, if photos need to be filtered by metadata and this significantly speeds up the work.
</p>
<p>
But before any actions that change or save photos, you need to upload the original photo, otherwise it will not be processed correctly. This is what this plugin does. Place it after the filters and before the place where the processing or saving of the photo begins.
