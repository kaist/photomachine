<h2>Collage plugin</h2>
The plugin combines several incoming photos into one, making a collage. <br>
First, set the size of the "substrate" in pixels. Next, add the elements. Each element has settings:
<ul>
<li>Position X (horizontal) and Y (vertical)</li>
<li>Dimensions in pixels (width and height)</li>
<li>How to customize incoming images: fit or fill. If fill is selected, the photo will be exactly the size of the element, but it will be cut off if it has other proportions.</li>
</ul>
The added items are displayed in the list. If you click on an item in this list, you can edit or delete it.<br>
<p>
<strong style="color:red;">Attention!</strong> If the collage does not fill to the end, and new images do not arrive for some time (timeout setting), the plugin sends the image that is not filled to the end.
