<h2>"Rotate/Flip" plugin"</h2>
<p>
The plugin can rotate the image and/or flip it around a vertical or horizontal axis.<br>
You can rotate all incoming images, or by "filter". For example, rotate only vertical images by 90 degrees so that all photos are horizontal in the end.

<strong style="color:red;">ATTENTION!</strong> Some photos, especially jpg directly from cameras, do not change orientation automatically. Try enabling "rotation from EXIF" in this plugin.
