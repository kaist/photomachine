<h2>Plugin "LUT"</h2>
The plugin applies the selected LUT to the photo. Let's are cube format files that contain information for color correction. They are usually used in video color correction, but they are great for photo processing. You can find ready-made beautiful LUTs on the Internet, but you can also create them yourself in specialized programs (for example, 3DLut creator). In addition, you can convert Lightroom presets to cube files, for example via hald image (a good online service and instructions can be found here <a href="https://sirserch.github.io/lut-creator-js /">lut creator</a>)
<p>
In the plugin settings, select the LUT file (in cube format). You can also configure the mixing of the source file and the processed one (as a percentage from 0 to 100, where 0 is the original image, and 100 is only with the applied LUT)
