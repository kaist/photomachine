<h2>Filter by camera/lens</h2>
The plugin filters photos by several possible fields from EXIF photos. This can be useful if, for example, you need to separate photos from different photographers or cameras:
<ul>
<li>By the name of the camera. Examples: Canon 5d, iPhone, 6d II, D700.</li>
<li>According to the lens model. For example: 70-200, 50</li>
<li>By the serial number of the camera.</li>
<li>By the "copyright" field, where you can enter an arbitrary value in some camera models. For example, the name of the photographer.</li>
</ul>
<p>
It is not necessary to prescribe full names, it is enough to specify a unique part for the filter. In order to find out what your camera writes in EXIF, right-click on the photo in Explorer and look at its properties. <br>
One plugin filters only by one name. If you need to filter multiple cameras, and for example, send photos from different cameras or photographers to different places, put several plugins in the project.

<strong style="color:red;">Attention!!!</strong> If the EXIF does not contain information about the camera/lens, then the plugin will not skip such photos in any case.

<strong>Example:</strong> photos from Ivanov's camera are sent to print with a filter by rating, and photos from two cameras of other photographers are sent to Google drive for a slideshow.<br><br>
